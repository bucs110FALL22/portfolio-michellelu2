# CS110 Final Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION 
My program will give the temperature of any city the user chooses. Addtionally, if the temperature is 50 degrees or higher, a random cat fact will be given, but if the temperature is less 50, a random number fact will be given instead.


## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS
None

## REFERENCES 
None

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS 
I would have used facts about dogs instead of the number facts but the API for dog facts was not working so we get numbers instead.
