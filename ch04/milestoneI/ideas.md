# Final Project Milestone #1

[Final Project Description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j3zgypVjPjzXl4pL1_Wpjvp3GLCW9zcFydkwUjNfNUA/edit?usp=sharing)

In order to start the Final Project for the course, you will need to decide on the following (remember, nothing is set in stone yet).

Review the sample Final Projects listed below and come up with 3 possible ideas of your own for your final project. Complete this document in **your** portfolio (CH 4). A few things to note:

1. ***Don't limit yourself***
    * I will help you scale it to something manageable, but it is  uch easier to scake something down than to scale up. Shoot for the stars.

2. ***Your idea WILL change, don't worry about the details yet.***
    * Just think of a general type of game, simulation, or other kind of program you would like to create.

***

For each one below you should have a basic description of a program idea, a couple of sentences at least. You can add as much info here as you like. This is where you want to brainstorm a little, and nothing is *'wrong'*.

## Project Idea 1

My first idea is a virtual tour of New York City. This will be an interactive tour that includes all the elements that can be seen in NYC, such as subways, skyscrapers, and rats. While on a tour of the city, the player has a mission to capture all the pesky rats in the city while avoiding getting injured by the heavy city traffics. The player can have bonus points for picking up trash that they might encounter while on the tour. 

## Project Idea 2

My second idea is a carnival. Within the carnival, the player can walk around and play the various games that are usually offered at carnivals, such as basketball, balloon pop, and ring toss. 

## Project Idea 3

My third idea is a war between cats and dogs. The player has an opportunity to choose between these two most common household pets at the beginning of the game. Then they will go through a series of challenges to collect their desired animal breeds, preparing for the ultimate fight against the other species at the end.
